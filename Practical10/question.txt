   > The upper outliers are as follows:
                             Entity      DALYs
     1860                   Eritrea  115120.37

     1050  Central African Republic  105411.10
     No lower outliers were found.
     Within the offered statistics, the above countries have higher DALYs and greater disease burden

2. draw a plot of this distribution mentioned in question 1
