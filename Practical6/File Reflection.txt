Was it easy? Was it hard? 
It was not easy. Instead, it was very difficult. I could not manage it by myself at all. 
I spent a lot of time on finishing this practical. At the same time, I asked a lot of people for help.
However, I still found it difficult to manage it.

Were there bits you enjoyed more (or less) than others?
I preferred the final job, the spatial_SIR I did.
Although it was the most difficult project I did. However, I learnt most from it.

What was the most important thing you learned?
Pay more attention to the logic.
