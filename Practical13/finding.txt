1. The length of the human SOD2 protein: 222 amino acids
2. The subcellular localisation	of the human SOD2 protein: Mitochondrion matrix
3. The range of percentage identities in the reported online BLAST results: 83.3-100%
4. The percentage identity of the best alignment with the mouse SOD2 protein (UniProt ID: P09671): 90.1%

workflow:
1. Get 2 protein sequences from UniProt
2. Generate a random sequence of same length
3. Get the BLOSUM62 matrix
4. Get the alignment score abd percentage of identical amino acids with BLOSUM62
5. Calculate percentage identity
6. Print results

5. The alignment score and percentage of identical amino acids for each of the three comparisons:
    Alignment results:
        Human vs Mouse - alignment score: 1097.0, Percent Identity: 90.09%
        Human vs Random - alignment score: -266.0, Percent Identity: 3.15%
        Mouse vs Random - alignment score: -275.0, Percent Identity: 3.15%

statement:
Human and mouse sequences are most closely related among human,mouse and random sequences.
As the alignment score of human VS mouse group is the smallest one, and the percent identity is the largest one.
